# StrideLength

## Purpose :
To find the stride lengths precisely.

## Procedure:
Use a sensor placed on one ankle and a  magnet on the other one and estimate the stride lengths.

## Magnetometer properties


## Visual Analysis:

### Test 1:
**Aim** : To understand the effect of magnets on the magnetometer when the magnets are placed linearly at a certain distance from the magnetometer.

**Protocol** : Please check these images images in [`Protocol-1`](https://github.com/ReDevVerse/StrideLength/tree/main/Visual%20Analysis/experiment%20protocol)

**Procedure for each session:**
<ol>
    <li>Place Shimmer and mark the distance(5cm,10,cm,30,cm , etc) you want to analyze with a scale.<\li>
    <li>Capture the first 5 seconds without magnet.<\li>
    <li>Capture next 5 secods with magnet places at specified distance.<\li>
    <li>Capture next 5 seconds by slightly shaking the magnet at the specified distance.<\li>
    <\ol>
    
***Note*** By doing the above procedure, the expected duration of each session would be 15 seconds. However, the data could be shown for some extended time. This was due to the delay in stopping the stopwatch or delay in stopping the data capture.
        
 **Results:** : Please refer to the plots in [`Plots-1`](https://github.com/ReDevVerse/StrideLength/tree/main/Visual%20Analysis/group%20plots/Test-1)

### Test 2:
**Aim:** To understand the effect of magnets on the magnetometer when a person is walking with Shimmer and magnets placed on ankle.

**Protocol:** Please check images in [`Protocol-2`](https://github.com/ReDevVerse/StrideLength/tree/main/Visual%20Analysis/experiment%20protocol)

**Procedure for each walk session:**
     <ol>
    <li> The total length of path travelled is 330 cm.<\li>
      <li>The data was captured while going from one end to the other and back so total length of track be assumed as 660cm.<\li>
        <li>For each walking session, the no of magnets used was either 0,1,2,3 or 6.<\li>
        <li>Data was captured while taking short and longer strides.<\li>
        <li>Shorter strides were close to 30cm, while the longer strides were between 75-90cm.<\li>
    <\ol>
        
**Results:** Please refer to the plots in [`Plots-2`](https://github.com/ReDevVerse/StrideLength/tree/main/Visual%20Analysis/group%20plots/Test-2)
