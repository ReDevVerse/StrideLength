# StrideLength

## Purpose :
To find the stride lengths precisely.

## Procedure:
Use a sensor placed on one ankle and a  magnet on the other one and estimate the stride lengths.


# Device : Magnets and Magnetometer on Shimmer device

## What is a magnetometer: A device used to measure the earths magnetic field. It can show the vector direction of the magnetic field

## Priliminary tests:

### Stage 1:
Visualize the graphs that show how the sensor reacts to magnets.
